# Olympic-History-Case-Study
I've tackled intermediate-level SQL questions based on a real Olympic history dataset from Kaggle. These questions were generated by Tech TFQ. I've attempted to solve them using my own methods.

You will find all the details from this website : https://techtfq.com/blog/practice-writing-sql-queries-using-real-dataset

#Step 1: Download the data from kaggle
#Step 2: import the data into databases
#step 3 : check the questions from above website
#step 4 : try to find out solutions by yourself for best practise.
